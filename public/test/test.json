	"description": "<p><i>The city will never be fully understood by those who cannot move fluently through its diffuse urban texture. So, like earlier generations of English intellectuals who taught themselves Italian in order to read Dante in the original, I learned to drive in order to read Los Angeles in the original.</i></p> <p><b>Reyner Banham, 1971</b> <br /><b><i>Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies</i></b> </p><p>Banhamâ€™s quote acted as a starting point in curating a month-long festival of films about Los Angeles. All of the films featured say something profound about the Los Angeles experience via the visual language of car culture, including dramatic vistas from elevated freeways, the never-ending stream of headlights cutting through mountain passes, dingy gas stations and violent car crashes.</p>",
